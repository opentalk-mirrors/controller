# Tariffs

Tariffs in {{ product_name }} can be created, edited, and deleted with the commandline using `opentalk-controller tariffs <COMMAND>`.

A tariff can restrict the {{ product_name }} resource usage by imposing a combination of different quota types.
The following quotas are supported:

| Quota Name               | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max_storage`            | The maximum allowed storage per user in bytes. This is a soft limit. When the limit is exceeded, a user can not store additional files. |
| `room_time_limit_secs`   | This quota restricts the total duration for which a tenant can utilize a meeting room, measured in seconds.                             |
| `room_participant_limit` | This quota sets a limit on the number of participants that can join a room.                                                             |
