# ACL Management

{{ product_name }} uses an in-memory Access Control List to efficiently track permissions. The controller maintains that list in
its database. Controllers will synchronize changes to the ACL by sending changesets to each other using RabbitMQ.

## Configuration

The section in the [configuration file](../core/configuration.md) is called `authz`.
