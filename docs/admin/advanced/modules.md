# Modules

Modules provide functionality that can be used inside meetings.

## Features

A module might have features that can be enabled or disabled in the
[configuration file](../core/configuration.md) or using [tariffs](./tariffs.md).
The features available can be obtained using the
[`modules`](#opentalk-controller-modules-subcommand) subcommand.
