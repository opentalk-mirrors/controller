# Metrics

The {{ product_name }} controller is collecting metrics and is exposing them through the `/metrics` endpoint.

## Configuration

The section in the [configuration file](../configuration.md) is called `metrics`.

By default, the `/metrics` endpoint refuses all connections. The access can be configured with an allowlist.

| Field       | Type     | Required | Default value | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowlist` | `string` | no       | -             | List of IP-Addresses or Subnet which are allowed to fetch metrics |

### Examples

#### Access denied (default)

```toml
[metrics]
allowlist = []
```

#### Only allow localhost

```toml
[metrics]
allowlist = ["127.0.0.0/8", "::ffff:0:0/96"]
```

#### Allow IPs and subnets

```toml
[metrics]
allowlist = ["1.1.1.1", "127.0.0.0/8"]
```

## Web-API

The metrics can be accessed via the `/metrics` endpoint in the [OpenMetrics Text Format](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics), which is utilized by [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#openmetrics-text-format).
