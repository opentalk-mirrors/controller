# Janus Room Server

!!! warning

    The `room_server` configuration section described here was deprecated in the
    {{ product_name }} Controller version 0.25.0, and is no longer supported in version 0.26.0
    or later. The successor is [LiveKit](./livekit.md).

## Historic content before {{ product_name }} Controller v0.21.0 and older

These are no longer valid configuration options in the {{ product_name }} controller, but the information remains available for the time being, as the older versions are available when needed.

> {{ product_name }} organizes video and audio streams through [Janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/) which is used as SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) for the conferences. The communication between the {{ product_name }} controller and Janus goes through either a direct websocket connection or [RabbitMQ](./rabbitmq.md). Multiple Janus instances can be configured for an {{ product_name }} deployment.
>
> The `room_server` section describes general settings that apply to all Janus instances that are used with the service. The individual Janus instances can be configured in the `room_server.connections` list field.
>
> ## Configuration
>
> The section in the [configuration file](./configuration.md) is called `room_server`.
