# Identity Provider

This page describes how the OIDC provider is configured in the controller.
Generic information for Keycloak and its configuration can be found in the [Keycloak section](keycloak.md).

## Configuration

In the past, configuration of OIDC and user search was done together within the [`keycloak`](keycloak_deprecated.md#deprecated-keycloak-configuration) section.
Starting with controller version 0.21.0, this is deprecated, support will be removed in the future.
It should be replaced with the separate [`oidc`](#configuration) and [`user_search`](user_search.md#user-search-configuration) sections.

The section in the [configuration file](configuration.md) is called `oidc`.

```toml
[oidc]
authority = "https://localhost:8080/auth/realms/OPENTALK"

[oidc.frontend]
client_id = "Frontend"

[oidc.controller]
client_id = "Controller"
client_secret = "v3rys3cr3t"

## OIDC and User Info

The following fields returned by the OIDC provider's `userinfo` endpoint are used by the {{ product_name }} Controller. These fields differ for authentication of normal users and services.

> Note: Previously these fields were required to be in the ID Token's claims, but the ID Token is no longer required.

### User Info fields for user login

#### Security considerations

For the `picture` field, the frontend will download the images found under the
provided URL. Therefore it is important to only provide URLs that are guaranteed
to not inject unwanted content, but rather have a policy which ensures that only
valid images are served.

### Access Token JWT fields for service login

| Field           | Type          | Required | Description                                       |

| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `roles` | `string[]` | yes      | A list of role identifiers that the service is allowed to provide |
