# Training Participation Report

## Overview

This module allows the creation of a participation report based of interactive
user feedback from participants.

The precondition is that the room creator is considered to be the trainer of the
course for which the participation is logged.

A participation report session can be enabled by a participant logged in as the
room owner, and will start as soon as at least one other participant is present
who is not the room owner. After a random amount of time within a predefined
range, the *initial checkpoint delay*, the first checkpoint is passed, and a
confirmation dialog is shown to all other participants. As soon as they press
the **Confirm** button, an entry of their presence is added to the log for that
checkpoint.

Repeatedly after another random amount of time within a predefined range, the
*checkpoint interval*, further checkpoints are passed, again bringing up the
confirmation dialog and storing log entries for each confirmation received from
the participants.

As soon as either no more room owner is present, no more other participant is
present, or the room owner sends the *disable presence logging* command, a
report is generated and stored as a file asset for the event.

Namespace for the signaling module: `training_participation_report`.

## Joining the room

### JoinSuccess

When joining a room, the `join_success` control event contains the module-specific fields described below.

#### Fields

| Field   | Type                        | Always | Description                                          |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `state` | `ParticipationLoggingState` | yes    | Current state of the participation logging procedure |

##### `ParticipationLoggingState`

- `disabled`: No participation logging is active, nothing to do for a client.
- `enabled`: Participation logging is enabled, either waiting for the initial timeout or the participant already confirmed the last checkpoint. A client should notify the participant about this state.
- `waiting_for_confirmation`: Participation logging is enabled, a checkpoint has already been passed and the newly joined participant can immediately confirm their presence.

### Joined

When joining a room, the `joined` control event sent to all other participants does not contain module-specific data.

## Commands

### EnablePresenceLogging

The `EnablePresenceLogging` action can be sent by the room creator to enable the presence logging. Presence logging will start immediately if at least one other participant is already in the meeting. If no other participant is present yet, presence logging will start as soon as the first other participant joins.

#### Fields

| Field                | Type     | Required | Description                         |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `action`             | `enum`   | yes      | Must be `"enable_presence_logging"` |
| `initial_checkpoint_delay` | `TimeRange` | no | The range for the number of minutes before the initial checkpoint is triggered (default: `{ "after": 600, "within": 1200 }`) |
| `checkpoint_interval` | `TimeRange` | no | The range for the number of minutes between the subsequent checkpoint is triggered (default: `{ "after": 6300, "within": 1800 }`) |

##### `TimeRange`

The `TimeRange` object contains these fields:

| Field    | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `after`  | `int`   | yes      | The earliest number of seconds after which the checkpoint can be created. Must be a strictly positive number.   |
| `within` | `int`   | yes      | The number of seconds within which the checkpoint can be created after the `after` value. Must be 0 or greater. |

#### Response

The creator receives a [PresenceLoggingEnabled](#presenceloggingenabled) message as a confirmation.

Can return [Error](#error) of kind `insufficient_permissions`, `presence_logging_already_enabled`.

### DisablePresenceLogging

The `DisablePresenceLogging` action can be sent by the room creator to disable presence logging.
