# OpenTalk Controller

See the [administration guide](docs/admin/README.md) for more information.

## Configuration

See the [configuration](docs/admin/configuration.md) chapter of the
administration guide for more information.

An example configuration is available in the
[`example/controller.toml`](example/controller.toml) file. It can be copied to the root directory:

```sh
cp ./example/controller.toml ./controller.toml
```

## Upgrading

See the [migration guide](docs/admin/migration.md) for information about upgrading.

## Build the container image

If you just want an image, that can be created with:

```bash
docker build . --tag <your tag>
```

If required, the image can be built with one of a small set of different base
images, a `Dockerfile-<baseimage>` is located in the root directory of this
project for each of them. `Dockerfile` is a symlink to the latest default image.

To build the image with a specific base image, execute in the root of the repository:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-<baseimage> . --tag <your tag>
```

## OpenTalk Controller API Specification

The <docs/developer/api.yaml> file contains the OpenTalk API specification formalized in OpenAPI
format.

### Checking the consistency with Spectral

[Stoplight Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral) is a linter tool
for structured data such as JSON and YAML. It contains built-in support to
ensure the consistency of an OpenAPI specification. These checks go far beyond
what most other linters detect, resulting in significantly higher consistency of
the OpenAPI specification.

#### Running the checks locally

##### Prerequisites

The subsequent commands assume that the project root is stored in the environment variable `PROJECT_ROOT` like this:

```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT="/path/to/opentalk/controller"
```

Alternatively if the project root is the current directory:

```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)"
```

##### With `spectral` installed

```bash
spectral lint --ruleset "$PROJECT_ROOT"/ci/spectral/openapi.yml "$PROJECT_ROOT"/docs/developer/api.yaml
```

##### With the `stoplight/spectral` Docker image

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$PROJECT_ROOT":/tmp stoplight/spectral lint --ruleset /tmp/ci/spectral/openapi.yml /tmp/api/controller/frontend_api.yaml
```
